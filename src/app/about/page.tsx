									<p>Thanks to my engineering life which was full of college events, learning designs and working with startup as freelance in my early days, I connect UX/UI design with real business goals, while providing delightful client experiences.
									</p>
									<p>Currently, I‚Äôm designing and solving design challenges in travel industry at Flipkart (travel and Cleartrip) with an incredible team. Previously, I was an solving Banking & Finance Space at Zeta Suite.</p>
									<p>Outside of my full-time commitments, I work with a select freelance client base to create phenomenal products and solutions.</p>
									<p>I‚Äôm passionate about building & designing thoughtful experiences to make sure your customers and users are satisfied when they‚Äôre using your products and services online.</p>
									<p>I also love documenting my journey and sharing it with the community to help others succeed and grow.</p>

								<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
									<p>Design has always been my passion and hobby since my early childhood. Although I studied electronics and electrical engineering in the traditional way at KIIT University, I learned to design on my own out of curiosity.
									</p>
									<p>This curiosity helped me to stay up-to-date from year to year and I‚Äôm still learning every single day to ensure I can deliver the most modern and effective solutions. I believe in working hard and smart instead of searching for ‚Äúhacks and shortcuts‚Äù.</p>
									<p>Nowadays, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to share and give back to the community, leading by example, writing detailed design articles, creating design courses and sharing my design journey to educate and inspire others.</p>

									<p>As technology progresses things are getting more and more complex. As a designer, I have a special opportunity to make these complex processes simple, delightful and joyous for every day use.

									<p>Design allows us to differentiate ourselves by showing attention and care about our customers and users. Everybody values design either consciously or unconsciously. This is why I love creating thoughtful, meaningful and polished experiences, which makes both the creators and customers happy.</p>
